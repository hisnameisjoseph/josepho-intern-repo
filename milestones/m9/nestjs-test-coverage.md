# Understanding the Focus Bear Coverage Bar & Writing Meaningful Tests (#16)

## ✅ Tasks

### Research how Jest generates test coverage reports in NestJS
I found that Jest generates test coverage reports by instrumenting the code and tracking which lines are executed during testing. Like using the command lines `jest --coverage` or `npm test -- --coverage`. I found this tutorial helpful for setting up NestJS Jest: [Jest testing: A complete tutorial](https://www.testim.io/blog/jest-testing-a-helpful-introductory-tutorial/)

### Run the test suite and view the test coverage report

### Identify untested areas and write additional tests to improve coverage

Research the concept of "meaningful test assertions" and why high coverage can sometimes be misleading

Refactor a weak test to ensure it has proper assertions

## ✅ Reflection (nestjs-test-coverage.md)
### What does the coverage bar track, and why is it important?
### Why does Focus Bear enforce a minimum test coverage threshold?
### How can high test coverage still lead to untested functionality?
### What are examples of weak vs. strong test assertions?
### How can you balance increasing coverage with writing effective tests?
