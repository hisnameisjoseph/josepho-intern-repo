## üîé Reflection

### Why are PRs important in a team workflow?
- Ensure code quality through peer review.
- Help detect bugs and logic errors before merging.
- Allow discussion and feedback on proposed changes.
- Create shared understanding and knowledge transfer across the team.
- Control and review merge conflicts systematically.

### What makes a well-structured PR?
- Clear and concise title summarising the change.
- Short description explaining **what** was changed and **why**.
- Small, focused changes that are easy to review.
- Clean commit history without unnecessary changes.
- Screenshots, test evidence, or context where helpful.

### What did you learn from reviewing an open-source PR?
- Real-world open-source projects follow high professional standards for PRs.
- Reviewers may not know each other personally, so clear context is important.
- Collaboration is often asynchronous, so a PR provides full context for reviewers to catch up.
- PRs are not just for code changes but also for communication and shared understanding.
