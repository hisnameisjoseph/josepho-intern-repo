## ðŸ”Ž Most Useful Thing I Learned

- After watching the tutorials ([React Dev Tools Intro](https://youtu.be/rb1GWqCJid4?si=6Gt00I_yPK8k1X2H) & [Redux DevTools Intro](https://youtu.be/BYpuigD01Ew?si=BahHsCrz0XzQGir0)):
  - I learned that **React Dev Tools** allows you to directly inspect the props and state of any React component in real-time, which makes debugging React apps much easier.
  - **Redux DevTools** helps visualize the entire action history and current state tree, which is extremely useful when troubleshooting complex state management flows.
  - **Lighthouse** gives detailed reports for performance and accessibility â€” helpful to improve the user experience of web apps.
