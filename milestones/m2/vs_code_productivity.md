## 📝 Reflection

### Which shortcuts do you think will be the most useful in your daily work?
Shortcuts like `⌘D`, `⌥⌘↓`, and `⇧⌥F` are especially helpful for editing and formatting markdown and coding files. 

`⌘P` and `⌘B` also help with the navigation in a large project like the ones at Focus Bear.

### How can keyboard shortcuts improve your productivity?
They reduce repetitive clicking, help me stay in flow when coding, and make switching between tasks faster. 

For example, using multiple cursors (`⌘D`) helps when editing repeated lines or variables, which saves significant time.
