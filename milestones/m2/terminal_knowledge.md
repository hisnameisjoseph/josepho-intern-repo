# Terminal Knowledge

## Which terminal client did you choose? Why?
I use MacOs built-in Terminal as my terminal client because I cannot be bothered to install another terminal client (like the alternative e.g. iTerm2). I have been using zsh as the terminal shell since it is the default for MacOs Terminal.

## What customizations (if any) did you make?
I have not made any customisations. I only just knew that I can actually customise terminal (like colour theme) and I am currently searching up to see if there is any themes or customisation that I would like to make for my Terminal. If I really want to change the colour of terminal, I found [**this github repo**](https://github.com/lysyi3m/macos-terminal-themes) which someone developed a public repo for MacOS users to change their colour theme. 

## What was the most useful command you learned today?
I have been reading [**Apple Terminal User Guide**](https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/terminal/welcome/mac) and [**Essential Unix Commands**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/essential-linuxunix-commands/) to see if there is anything that seems to be interesting. command that I am interested. Besides the ones that I often use: `cd`, `mkdir` and `mv` command, since I mostly use Terminal for navigating the files / folders and run the application or using Git, I have not found any command that is particularly useful. If I really have to say, maybe commands like `cp` to copy a file or `touch` to creat an empty file (e.g. `touch terminal_knowledge.md) could be quite useful if I don't use my MacOs interface to do these commands.
