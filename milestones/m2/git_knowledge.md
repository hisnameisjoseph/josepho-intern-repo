## Reflection Questions
### Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?
Yes. I have used Git since the start of my university studies in 2018. At university, we used GitLab for version control when submitting projects and assignments. Our assignments were submitted via personal GitLab repositories, where tutors marked the work and provided feedback directly on the repo (often through branches or merge requests).

I regularly used basic Git commands like `git pull`, `git push`, and `git fetch` to sync changes, update repositories, and submit work. Iâ€™ve also worked with branches for feature development and used commits to track changes throughout project work.

### Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?
I haven't used Git Client before, I have been using Git command lines for many projects and assignments during university. I am comfortable to use Git command line at the moment, I am also happy to learn how to use Git clients if required or recommended.

I will use my free time to explore git client to see if I should start using it.

### What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?
The existence of Git client (thought people always use terminal to write git commands lines.) And the fact that there is even "paid" GUI for git client is mind-blowing! I guess people really need something that is more visualised when they are working on projects.

From my understanding (articles online), there are many GUI as Git clients, e.g. GitHub Desktop, GitKraken, Sourcetree, TortoiseGit, SmartGit, GitForce, etc.
