# Learning Goals

## What do you hope to learn from this internship?
### Real-world expereince with frameworks that are currently being used in the industry. 

- Gain real-world backend development / DevOps experience using industry-standard frameworks (e.g. NestJS, Typescript, AWS, Docker, Infrastructure as Code).
-	Learn how backend systems are structured in a production environment, not just theory but practical application (code reviews, deployments, CI/CD, version control, etc).
-	Develop DevOps practices (e.g. containers, deployment pipelines, monitoring) to understand how code runs after it’s written and how to configure the infrastructure
-	Understand how Agile workflows work in real software teams (team communication, collaborative development).


## What skills are you most excited to develop?

Backend development (NestJS, Typescript, Node.js)
- as well as DevOps tools (Docker, AWS, IaC, CI/CD)
- Working with version control and collaboration tools (Git, GitHub workflows)
- Improve problem-solving skills when debugging or troubleshooting backend issues
- Learning how to read and understand existing codebases

## What do you think you can contribute to the team?
- A willingness to ask questions and learn quickly when I encounter unfamiliar technologies.
- A careful, detail-oriented approach (I tend to be strong in documenting, tracking issues, and following processes carefully if I understand them).
- A fresh perspective as someone newer to the industry — sometimes noticing edge cases or small user experience issues.

 
## What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
- Reading and navigating large codebases that were written by others, especially in frameworks that I am not familiar with.
- Fully understanding backend architecture and design patterns (e.g. NestJS, database models, API design).
- Troubleshooting technical problems independently (knowing how to search, where to look, and how to debug more systematically).

## What does success in this internship look like for you?
- Becoming confident enough to work on backend dev independently with minimal supervision.
- Building enough skill that I can apply for junior developer or graduate software engineer roles confidently after this internship.
- Having a clearer understanding of my technical strengths and gaps for further study after the internship.
- Expanding my professional network through the team, mentors, and supervisors.
