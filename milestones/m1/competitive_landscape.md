## What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?
I think what makes Focus Bear different is the features it offers, cover many aspects of the Focus / Well-being (routine builder, wellness...etc) applications unlike other competitors focus on specific or fewer features. Focus bear has its own value proposition in the market.
## If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
I think it would be the features that the app offers. It would be a good deal if users can save money by installing an app (or even use the premium functions) instead of having two or more apps for routine builder, well-being, focus and productivity (e.g. Freedom + Routinery would be around AU86 per year). 
Easier to manage if features are all-in-one application, and compatability would be key for users to have seamless experience.
## What‚Äôs one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn‚Äôt?
From the table, we can see that other apps have Widgets, sync with Calendar and Apple Health for mood tracking (which is related to well-being). Apple also comes with journaling which I believe is related to the wellbeing asepect. 
Focus sounds are free and available on the Freedom Desktop app.
Routinery can add friends to check their routines.
## Based on your research, what‚Äôs one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
I feel like if Focus bear wants to become an app that not only focuses on blocking distracting websites and apps, but also emphasises on the well-being of the users (build routines, with exercise or training for cognitive and mental health), it could potentially utilise the calendar (whether it's Apple or Google Calendar) as many users probably already have (or even haven't) the habit of using Calendar for daily tasks, it could be a good opportunity to increase the usage of the app if the routine could be compatible with the Calendar so that people can be easier to see the visualised version of the day-to-day tasks on both Focus Bear app and the Calendar app they have already been using... espcially for those users who have more than one routine in a day.
