# Company Reflection

## Why do you think Focus Bear was created?

I believe Focus Bear was created to improve the productivity and overall well-being of individuals diagnosed with ADHD or Autism. During the onboarding session, Jeremy shared that he was diagnosed with ADHD himself, which gave him firsthand understanding of the challenges many neurodivergent individuals face. He also presented data showing that people with ADHD are more likely to experience depression, higher dropout rates, and difficulty staying productive in environments like university, where external accountability is limited and distractions are abundant.

## What problem is Focus Bear solving?

Focus Bear addresses the difficulty of staying focused and maintaining routines, especially for individuals with ADHD. One key feature is its ability to monitor whether a user is staying on track with their tasks — for example, checking if the content they’re watching on YouTube aligns with their study topic (e.g., biology during a biology study session). In addition to productivity, the app also encourages positive routines and habits, such as exercise and mindfulness, to support mental health and long-term consistency.

## Why do you think this mission is important?

As Jeremy pointed out in the presentation, ADHD diagnoses are becoming more common, and the associated challenges — like distraction, hyperactivity, and burnout — can significantly impact people’s opportunities and quality of life. Focus Bear provides tools that help bridge this gap, enabling users to function more effectively in academic or work environments. This can lead to better outcomes both personally and professionally.

## How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?

This mission strongly aligns with my personal values. I've seen many of my peers, and even myself, struggle with focus and productivity. Especially during university, when flexible schedules and tight deadlines created a difficult environment to manage without strong habits. I’m particularly interested in tools that help people build structure, improve their mental well-being, and make more intentional use of their time.

## Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?

Yes, I personally relate to almost everything Focus Bear is working to address. During my time at university, I struggled with concentration and often found myself behind on deadlines, not because of a lack of effort, but because my study time wasn’t used effectively. Distractions, poor routines, and inconsistent productivity were frequent challenges. I believe a tool like Focus Bear would have helped me navigate those issues more effectively and made space for more meaningful downtime and social connection.

## Do you know someone with ADHD or autism or even someone without a diagnosis who has struggled socially or to perform well at uni? How might Focus Bear help them?

I think just like I mentioned above, many of my friends and I (who have been diagnosed with ADHD) struggled with social connection and performance in university due to poor productivity (have to spend more time on tasks or studies), and I believe, nowadays, it is inevitable to utilise online resources throughout the learning process. Therefore, apps that simply block the website or apps like Youtube or Tiktok do not help with the learning process as many people learn and gain knowledge through social platforms like those, which used to be seem as distractions. And Focus Bear addresses the point that they can understand what content is the user watching to decide if it is a distraction or something useful, which is great.
