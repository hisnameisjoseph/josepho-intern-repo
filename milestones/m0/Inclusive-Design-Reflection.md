## Inclusive Design Reflection

### How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?
- clear and concise language
- diverse communication channels (see if the users or teamates prefer checking notifications on Discord, email or other media channels), or if the teammate / user prefers in-person communication or online
- Offer information in multiple formats (e.g., written + visual or examples) for easier understanding.
- Allow extra time to process‚Äîdon‚Äôt expect instant replies or decisions. (I need this)
- Share advance notice when tasks, meetings, or deadlines change to reduce stress. (I also need this)

Personally, I have found that writing in bullet points and giving teammates the option to respond asynchronously works well.

### What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?
- Overwhelming users with too much text / buttons or complex onboarding flows.
- Offer only one colour theme without alternatives, which may be overstimulating for some ASD users (especially if it is too colourful). Check out this article https://neurolaunch.com/autism-color-palette/

I believe adding a Night Mode / Dark Theme would help neurodivergent users who are sensitive to light or visual clutter. Some users may experience sensory overload from bright interfaces, especially at night. Dark modes are easier on the eyes and can improve usability for users with migraines or visual processing sensitivity.

### What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?
- provide flexibility (like options) for communication channels, in-person or online meetings and promote inclusiveness.
- I will make sure writing documentation in a format that‚Äôs easy to skim:
  - with bullet points
  - with bold text for highlighting
  - structured and succinct
  - with graph / picture if available
 
### First-person account: What did I learn?
I read the article [*"42 Time-Management Apps and Hacks That Work for ADHD Brains"*](https://www.additudemag.com/punctuality-time-blindness-adhd-apps-tips/) on ADDitude Magazine. It included quotes and survey data from nearly 2,000 adults with ADHD.

Key takeaways:
- Many struggle with time blindness and hyperfocus
- Strategies like "pre-timers", colour-coded lists, and co-working apps help them stay on track
- They prefer task-oriented tools with minimal distractions
It helped me realise that even small features (like a countdown or visual progress bar) can make a huge difference.

### üí¨ Hypothetical user support response

User: I‚Äôve been staring at my to-do list for hours and still can‚Äôt start anything. I really want to use Focus Bear to stay productive. I feel like I‚Äôm failing and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it.‚Äù

My response: Hi! Thanks for being honest. Sometimes it feels overwhelming to even just think of the tasks and things you want to achieve! What you're going through is totally valid and more common than you think... try starting with just one small routine‚Äîeven a 5 or 10-minute focus session. Let that be enough for now! Also, if it helps, you can explore breaking tasks down into even smaller chunks inside Focus Bear, take more short breaks while ensuring you stay focus whenever you want. Let us know, we‚Äôre here to support you üí™
