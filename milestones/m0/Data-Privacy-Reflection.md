## Data Privacy Reflection

### What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?
- strong password
- MFA for strict access
- be aware of phishing attack
- Any other apporach that can compromise the integrity of the security of data - make sure only access or store sensitive data when necessary and through authorised tools. 

### How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?
- encryption (e.g. AES), access control, secured channels (like SFTP) for sharing data, secure deletion of the digital file or hard drive destruction in some of the cases.

### What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?
- clicking phishing emails, weak passwords,  share personal information online, don't use MFA


## Identify at least one habit or practice you can adopt to improve data security in your role.
- use strong password, use MFA, change password frequently, being cautious of clicking any links or requests

## Document at least one key learning or security measure you will implement.
- use MFA more often (I personally not a big fan of it because if I change my phone (for various reasons, sometimes the authenticator app wouldn't work)
- learn how to encrypt data?

## Two specific examples of confidential data at Focus Bear (beyond general 'personal (user) data')
- User browsing history related to focus tracking
- Health related personal data (e.g. as the Focus Bear privacy policy mentions, health data like the ones that are stored in the tasks for routines, if the person has some information like "taking ADHD meds" or "Inject Insulin") would be stored by Focus bear and they are confidential.


## A short personal story or real example of how you avoided a security issue or used a best practice at work or school in the past, and how youâ€™ll apply it at Focus Bear

Since I have limited expereince in working with the industry, I do not have many stories or examples that is fully-related to this question. However, I do have an industrial project with Canberra Health Services (Canberra Hospital) where we were developing an time-tracking software system for their clinical trial unit. Through out the project, our client provided dummy data (instead of actual trials that have been worked on) to us for us to test the system in the later stages to avoid any security issues as many trials (which has patients involved) should not be disclosed to us. I understand that my role as a back-end developer intern could potentially need to handle sensitive / personal data. I have already made it a habit to:
- make sure the data can only be accessed by individuals who are authorised to access
- never upload anything to GitHub that includes user info or internal documents, espcailly in a public repo
- protect my work enviroment (laptop, account access) by setting MFA and log out when I am not using the device if necessary.
