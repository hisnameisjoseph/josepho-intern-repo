## Agile Ceremonies:

### How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?
Clear and visualised prioritisation of tasks, timeline and expectations.
Work load and capacity can be adjusted (e.g. estimated efforts), improvement and feedback can be addressed (for continuous improvment and create positive work environment within the team).
Feedback loop can encourage communication, reduce misalignment and ensure the information and expectations are clear and transparent. 

### Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?
I believe all of them are important for my role. As I am hoping to gain experience through the whole journey and process of the work flow. To be specific, 
the planning and prioritisation stage is important as I have just started doing this internship and I have a lot of frameworks to learn and understand. 
I have to make sure the communication is clear in order to prevent any delays in work due to any potential lack of skills (skill gap between the expectations and my ability)
I think the retrospective part would also be crucial as the reflection would be helpful to adjust the future workload or expectations.
