## Agile Ceremonies:

### How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?
Clear and visualised prioritisation of tasks, timeline and expectations.
Work load and capacity can be adjusted (e.g. estimated efforts), improvement and feedback can be addressed (for continuous improvement and create positive work environment within the team).
Feedback loop can encourage communication, reduce misalignment and ensure the information and expectations are clear and transparent. 

### Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?
I believe all of them are important for my role. As I am hoping to gain experience through the whole journey and process of the work flow. To be specific, 
the planning and prioritisation stage is important as I have just started doing this internship and I have a lot of frameworks to learn and understand. 
I have to make sure the communication is clear in order to prevent any delays in work due to any potential lack of skills (skill gap between the expectations and my ability)
I think the retrospective part would also be crucial as the reflection would be helpful to adjust the future workload or expectations.

I attended the mobile team stand-up meeting on Monday, 2nd June, from 1:30pm to around 3:00pm. The meeting followed a structured format with time-boxed segments. Team members shared updates on what they worked on, blockers, and goals for the next sprint. I found this format very efficient compared to my previous project meetings during my ANU capstone, where discussions often ran long and lacked structure. I also received the meeting invite via email from Jeremy, which I can provide as evidence.

One change I will make to improve team collaboration is to raise blockers earlier through the Discord channels or GitHub issues, rather than waiting until meetings. This will help resolve issues faster and keep the workflow moving. I realised during the Monday meeting that many blockers the mobile team members raised were mainly for discussions (like who can take the issue or who has time to deal with the task etc).
