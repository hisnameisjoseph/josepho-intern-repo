**My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is:**  
Still figuring that out — will add later.

### 📈 Feedback & Growth

Honest, specific, and ideally with examples.  
Private is preferred for critical feedback; public is fine for praise.

Gently point it out with context. If it’s technical, show me how to improve it.  
Just giving hints might delay my learning and productivity unnecessarily.

**I appreciate it when teammates:**
- Share learning resources (e.g. helpful videos or websites on NestJS/AWS)
- Ask for my input
- Check in if I seem overwhelmed
