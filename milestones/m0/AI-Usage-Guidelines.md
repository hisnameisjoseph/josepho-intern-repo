## AI usage guidelines

### When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?
AI is useful for:
- Generating drafts (e.g., writing emails or documentation)
- Summarising long articles or meeting notes
- Providing coding suggestions (e.g., syntax or structure, algorithm)

I rely on my own skills for:
- Tasks requiring critical thinking or creativity
- Ensuring context, nuance, and intent are correct
- Reviewing AI-generated code for bugs or inefficiencies /redundancies 

### How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?
Always double check and understand the content generated by AI, espcially in terms of AI for coding, it is important to understand how to read the language and the algorithms before implementing it. 
It is better to use AI as a tool by feeding / interacting it with your personal ideas and provide all sort of relevant information. E.g. write down things (codes or document paragraph) in your own words 
and let it help you to spot the potential errors, wording, tone and logic flow so that it could save your time without overly-relying on it.

### What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?
Never provide sensitive data to AI tools.
Encrypt the codes or using dummy codes if necessary.

## Task - Using AI
### Example
I used ChatGPT to help revise a paragraph in my User Manual for Me to improve clarity and tone, as well as helping me to formulate my user manual into markdown file (code provided by ChatGPT).

I revised it and edited it based on the format that I want to present, and confirm if there is any information that was not included or missed when ChatGPT generated the md code. 


### ðŸ’¡ One best practice I will follow when using AI tools at Focus Bear:

Always review and edit AI-generated output before using it, and never input sensitive or private information into AI tools.
