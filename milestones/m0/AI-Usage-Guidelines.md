## AI usage guidelines

### When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?
AI can assist with repetitive or data-heavy tasks (only if the data is not sensitive) and I should always rely on my skills when working on tasks that requre critical thinking, creativity and my personal perspective.
For algorithms and though process, AI can be helpful for building a better flow, but I still need to be aware of copyright or plagiarism issues.

### How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?
Always double check and understand the content generated by AI, espcially in terms of AI for coding, it is important to understand how to read the language and the algorithms before implementing it. 
It is better to use AI as a tool by feeding / interacting it with your personal ideas and provide all sort of relevant information. E.g. write down things (codes or document paragraph) in your own words 
and let it help you to spot the potential errors, wording, tone and logic flow so that it could save your time without overly-relying on it.

### What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?
Never provide sensitive data to AI tools.
Encrypt the codes or using dummy codes if necessary.
