## Cyber Security Guidelines:

### What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?
MFA, strong password (special characters, upper and lower cases and no easy to guess personal information)
I can probably improve with ensuring not using the same password with different accounts across different platforms (currently only use the same passwords (multiple password combinations) with the some of the accounts that have MFA enabled)
Be cautious of any suspicious links, files and websites.

### How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?
Frequently change passwords (make it as a routine), be cautious of the information being shared with others.
Back up devices and update them as often as possible. Secure wifi and connections, install antivirus software when possible. And make sure I lock my devices with strong passwords when I am not using it.

### What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?
As mentioned above, but having additional security features like using biometrics: fingerprint (in-use on my MacBook), Face-ID for my phone can streghthen the security of my devices. 
On top of that, I will regularly monitor my account activity to make sure there is no unusual behaviour activity from my accounts. 

### What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?
1. Change passwords and enable MFA (if it hasn't been enabled)
2. Remove suspicious device or account access (revoke access).
3. Report it, with potential security breach and what could have possibly been accessed from the unauthorised access of the account and data.
4. Monitor related accounts and data access (to see if there's other suspicious activity)
5. Reflect on that to see how I can strengthen my account access or prevent security breach in the future.

Currently I do not have password manager set up :(
In terms of a new habit that I will adopt at Focus bear:
I will review my GitHub and Google account activity logs regularly (weekly if possible), and report any unusual access patterns or login attempts. As I have already been using other methods (e.g. strong password, MFA) to protect my security and privacy of personal data a long time ago.
