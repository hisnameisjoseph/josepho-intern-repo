## Professionalism Reflection

### Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?
- I have experienced great teamwork and professionalism, mainly from the dynamic of the team (e.g. people taking initiatives, effective communication while the team leader can guide the team to achieve a common goal). 

- Professionalism comes from the way people interact with each other, with respect, and promote positive environments for feedback.
None of my past experiences was perfect, especially when it comes to the definition of "great" teamwork. Many were lack of communication and accountability.

- One example that stands out was during my honours capstone project at ANU, where I worked in a small team to develop a clinical time-tracking system.
  - Our team wasn’t perfect—at times we struggled with deadlines—but what made the experience “great” was how we adapted. For example, we maintained regular check-ins so everyone can provide their feedback which had, throughout the project, improve the work environment and productivity.
  - We also used documentations like, decision-making and risks matrix and engineering log to keep each members accountable (e.g. what they chose to do -> their actions -> was it effective -> anything that could be improved if it occurred next time).
  - On top of that, I played the role of someone who often evaluated others’ work and gave feedback based on clarity and structure (Project coordinator / evaluator). Even though I wasn’t the loudest in the group, my teammates respected that I preferred to speak once I had thought things through, and that mutual understanding helped build trust. It showed me that great teamwork isn’t about being perfect—it’s about adapting, showing respect, and being accountable.

### What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?
- wording, tone in messages, use tools like Grammarly or ChatGPT to double check the tone and format for documentation and emails, maybe pronouns in emails and regulary check-up on team members would be great?.
- double-check my wording and tone, especially for written messages. I will use tools like Grammarly or ChatGPT to make sure my tone is professional and respectful.
- I will be mindful of how I phrase feedback—focusing on the task, not the person.
- At Focus Bear, I also plan to use pronouns in my email signature and check in on quieter teammates though out my internship, because I know how it feels to be overlooked when you’re processing internally.

### How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?
- I’m happy to join casual catchups like coffee or tea breaks. I think these help people bond outside of tasks, which makes feedback and collaboration smoother later.
- I aim to be consistently reliable: completing tasks on time, engage in team activities, communicating early if I need help, and giving constructive feedback when I see areas for improvement.
