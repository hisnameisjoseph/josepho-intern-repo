## Professionalism Reflection

### Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?
- I have experienced great teamwork and professionalism, mainly from the dynamic of the team (e.g. people taking initiatives, effective communication while the team leader can guide the team to achieve a common goal).
- Professionalism comes from the way people interact with each other, with respect, and promote positive environments for feedback.
None of my past experiences was perfect, especially when it comes to the definition of "great" teamwork. Many were lack of communication and accountability. 

### What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?
- wording, tone in messages, use tools like Grammerly or ChatGPT to double check the tone and format for documentation and emails, maybe pronouns in emails and regulary check-up on team members would be great?. 

### How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?
- take breaks (coffee catch-ups or tea breaks) or trivia?
- make myself engaging in team activities and provide constructive feedback.
