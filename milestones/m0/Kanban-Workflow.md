## Kanban workflow

### How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
Clear progress like which task to work on (can assign tasks and tag users), limit WIP to avoid overload. Clear priorities by dividing the tasks into differnt stages.
Making sure the priorities are clear by listing down the tasks with due dates.
Can focus on the task that I should be working on by limiting Work In Progress.

### How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
Besides the items I mentioned in the previous answer, I can improve my workflow by:
- Reviewing and updating the board regularly to reflect actual progress, not just planned work.
- Using Kanban to identify bottlenecks or tasks that are stuck and adjust my focus accordingly.
-	Breaking tasks into **smaller, actionable items** to reduce ambiguity and make progress easier to track.
-	Using the board as a reflection tool during retrospectives to understand where I can optimise how I work or how I plan tasks.
