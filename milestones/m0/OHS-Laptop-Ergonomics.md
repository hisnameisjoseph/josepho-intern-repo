## OHS Laptop Ergonomics - Reflection

### What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)

- I can use external monitor or use a laptop stand during my placement.

### What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)

- sitting upright, don't hunch. Maintain a good distance between the screen and my eyes.

### How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)

- Use Focus bear for movement breaks / pomodoro technique, or something that like iPhone has the function to detect if my phone screen is too close to my face.
