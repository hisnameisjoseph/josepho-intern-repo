## OHS Laptop Ergonomics - Reflection

### What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)

- I added an external monitor (positioned at eye level) to reduce neck strain from looking down at my laptop screen when I am at home. I also started using a Bluetooth keyboard, mouse, and laptop stand, which lets me keep a healthier distance from the screen and avoid hunching.****

### What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)

- Since starting the internship, I’ve made an effort to:
  - Sit upright, with my feet flat and shoulders relaxed.
  - Take breaks every 20 minutes to an hour, even if just to stretch or walk around briefly.
  - Check my screen height every morning to ensure it’s still at the right level.
I found myself slouching sometimes, so hopefully the adjustments helped me stay more physically comfortable and focused in the near future.

### How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)

- Use Focus bear for movement breaks / pomodoro technique or my deep work sessions (20 to 50 min work, 5 to 10 min break), stretch and look 20 feet (6 meters) away during the break.
- In addition, I use my iPhone’s screen distance alert (part of Screen Time settings) to stop myself from holding the phone too close during breaks.
After a few days of following these reminders, I noticed I felt less neck tension in the evenings, and my focus during work blocks improved.
