## Agile Principles:

### What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?
- Benefits: Fixed-length sprint for planned, feature-based work (iterative approach). Better for predictability. Promote collaborations and transperancy
- by regular check-ins and retrospectives. 
- Challenges: Flexibility, difficult to implement for small projects that have less peopple involved (for appointing Scrum master or Product Owner).
- Require strong team communication, and the potential of [**scope creep**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/business-studies/what-is-scope-creep-in-project-management/)
- if deliverables are unclear or not prioritised correctly.


### How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?
Agile can help me stay focused by breaking work into manageable tasks and prioritising what is more important. 
It encourages regular check-ins, which makes it easier to ask for help and stay aligned with team goals. 
The Sprint iterative approach supports my learning by allowing quick feedback and continuous improvement.
