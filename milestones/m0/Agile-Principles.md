## Agile Principles:

### What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?
- Benefits: Fixed-length sprint for planned, feature-based work (iterative approach). Better for predictability. Promote collaborations and transparency
- by regular check-ins and retrospectives. 
- Challenges: Flexibility, difficult to implement for small projects that have less people involved (for appointing Scrum master or Product Owner).
- Require strong team communication, and the potential of [**scope creep**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/business-studies/what-is-scope-creep-in-project-management/)
- if deliverables are unclear or not prioritised correctly.


### How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?
Agile can help me stay focused by breaking work into manageable tasks and prioritising what is more important. 
It encourages regular check-ins, which makes it easier to ask for help and stay aligned with team goals. 
The Sprint iterative approach supports my learning by allowing quick feedback and continuous improvement.


### Scrum vs Kanban (my own words with the help of ChatGPT)
- **Scrum:**
  - Uses fixed-length sprints (e.g. 2–4 weeks) to deliver work in small, planned batches.
  - Has defined roles like Scrum Master and Product Owner.
  - Includes specific ceremonies such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, retrospectives, and sprint reviews.
  - Best suited for teams working on feature-based, structured projects with **predictable** workflows.
  - Emphasises commitment to sprint goals and **avoids changes mid-sprint**.

- **Kanban:**
  - More flexible and continuous; there are no fixed-length sprints.
  - Doesn’t require formal roles or ceremonies unlike Scrum (Scrum master, Product owner etc).
  - Focuses on **visualising tasks** using a board and limiting work-in-progress (WIP) to improve flow.
  - Ideal for teams with constantly shifting priorities or ongoing tasks (like bug fixes or support).
  - Encourages continuous delivery and improvement without strict sprint boundaries.
 
### Agile Principle I Find Most Useful:
As an intern still learning the tech stack for Focus Bear, I find this principle helpful because it allows me to adapt to feedback (espcailly from FocusBear QA bot right now), shift priorities when I hit blockers, stay flexible, and improve based on what I’ve learned so far. It encourages a mindset of flexibility, iteration and continuation.

### Example from ANU TechLauncher

- In my ANU TechLauncher capstone project, we used a mix of Scrum-style and Kanban approach with weekly meetings to plan, assign tasks, and share progress.
- One teammate acted as a PM (like a Scrum Master), helping guide discussions and manage priorities.
- We experienced some delays when waiting for the next sprint to address blockers—this showed the limits of rigid sprints.
- It helped me appreciate Kanban’s flexibility for ongoing prioritisation, especially useful in dynamic or smaller teams, the only problem we faced was that we used Trello early on in the project and the issues weren't updated frequently enough (like members don't update it even if it has already been completed), so the visualisation was messy and hard to track who finished the tasks and what was actually completed. We moved to GitHub Project (with the Kanban board) and it was better since more people update the issues and changes on the Kanban board.
- These experiences shaped how I now approach Agile at Focus Bear, breaking tasks down, regular check-ins, and improving iteratively.
