## Agile Roles:

### What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?
I signed up as a backend intern, and currently my role involves learning the team's tech stack (e.g. NestJS, AWS, IaC, Docker etc) 
and I am working on completing the assigned issues. 

I would love to contribute to the Agile process by breaking work into smaller tasks, participating in team discussions, 
and support improvements that align with project's sprint goals when required.

During onboarding, I reached out to Jeremy to clarify an issue related to Focus Bear ID (one of the onboarding issues) as well as other information like "when, where and how" I can work and survive the internship. His response helped me understand how the team configures (their workstyle, working environment. He also invited me to an Mobile team meeting to see how a team functions and I learn a lot (I chatted with the memebers after the meeting) in terms of the culture and connections between members. This interaction showed me how important it is to ask early and stay unblocked. Overal experience has been pretty good so far.


### How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?
Currently I am still working on the onboarding issues, but I believe overall my work will be required to collaborate with other teams like FE, QA, mobile dev team  as well as product and project managers etc.
I also have to interact with project managers to get feedback and clarify requirements.

Currently I am still working on my onboarding tasks, I believe I will get in touch with more members of the team once I proceed to the issues that are more related to the team I am working with. By that time, I expect to collaborate frequently with the backend team. To improve teamwork, Iâ€™ll ensure my changes include clear instructions / comments to make sure our team can work efficiently.
