## Agile Roles:

### What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?
I signed up as a backend intern, and currently my role involves learning the team's tech stack (e.g. NestJS, AWS, IaC, Docker etc) 
and I am working on completing the assigned issues. 
I would love to contribute to the Agile process by breaking work into smaller tasks, participating in team discussions, 
and support improvements that align with project's sprint goals when required.

### How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?
Currently I am still working on the onboarding issues, but I believe overall my work will be required to collaborate with other teams like FE and QA, mobile team etc.
I also have to interact with project managers to get feedback and clarify requirements.
