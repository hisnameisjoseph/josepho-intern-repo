# When you get stuck - what next? #72

## Tasks

### Research best practices for troubleshooting coding problems
#### Spend 30 minutes talking with Chat GPT to understand different perspectives on using AI in coding. When is it helpful and when is it not?
Some of the best practices that I found include:
- Understand the problem
- Use Logging: check backend logs, console logs/errors, network requests
- Debugging tools
- Break down the problem: divide the issue into smaller, manageable parts
- Collaboration, asking for help & documentation: leverage team knowledge and resources
- Reproduce the issue: create a minimal, reproducible example
- Fix the root cause, not the symptom: would be helpful to understand the issue by writing out what you know and don't know.
- Use binary search: to narrow down the source of the problem


### Develop a decision-making framework:
#### Create a flowchart or decision tree in Miro outlining scenarios where each resource (Google, AI tools, colleagues) would be most appropriate.

#### Consider factors such as:
- The complexity of the problem.
- The sensitivity of the information.
- The urgency of the task.

## Reflection
### When do you prefer using AI vs. searching Google?
### How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?
### What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?
